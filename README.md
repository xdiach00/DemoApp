# DemoApp
DemoApp for Synetech

Completed Bonus Tasks:
1) Sorting type is saving between app launches (Shared Preferences)
2) The list of places is not reloaded
3) Added transitions from main activity to fragment and back

Problems:
1) The "Distance" sort isn't working correct because of incorrect i don't know what :(
2) Some images have poor quality if they are stretched and cropped (centerCrop) to the ImageView size. But this, I hope, is due to the fact that they are stored on the server in low resolution :)

I tried my best to do the project as quickly as possible, because this week will be difficult in terms of studying.

The installing file is app-debug.apk
