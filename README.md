# DemoApp
DemoApp for Synetech

Completed Bonus Tasks:
1) Sorting type is saving between app launches (Shared Preferences)
2) The list of places is not reloaded (Fragment)
3) Added transitions from main activity to fragment and back
4) Using user's location to count distance

Problems:
1) Some images have poor quality if they are stretched and cropped (centerCrop) to the ImageView size. But this, I hope, is due to the fact that they are stored on the server in low resolution :)

Technologies:
Kotlin

Libraries:
1) Retrofit 2
2) GSON converter
3) Kotlin Coroutines (but for object fragment .enqueue)
4) Picasso
5) Play Services Location

I tried my best to do the project as quickly as possible. I hope that this has not affected the quality of the code very much, although I know that it is far from the best :)

The installing file is app-debug.apk
